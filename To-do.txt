To-do:
1. Make it such that when you select a county, it generates a map of just that county's tracts
2. Make it such that when you select a tract, it pull up all the shit for the profile of that tract
3. Make the "landing page" of the site which contains some basic visualizations and 
4. Make some sort of visualization for how the tract changes designation when you play around with sliders
5. Make a "top 5" and "bottom 5" for each tract's categories, displayed in an aesthetic manner
6. Add reset button(s)


1. Clicking some changes in the sidebar will change the map and update the dataframe used in the backend to do further calcs/create visuals
2. Changing the weights of sliders will update the visuals and add an option to update the map


Possible Ways to solve tract mismatch issue:
1. Perform a point-in-polygon using the approximate location of tracts in the calenviroscreen data to check if 
   those tracts are inside of the polygons of the geojson data. If they are, then change one of the tract values to match the other

TO-DO IMMEDIATELY
1. Make the interactions actually update the visuals. There is some problem with backend info being sent forward
2. After you've selected a tract, add an "optimize" button that autoselects the most favorable combination of weights for that tract's score
	- To go further, can add an optimize button for different aggregation methods and calculation methods

Meeting Notes:
1. Create a barchart with counties and what percentage of tracts in them are disadvantaged (purpose is to make the small tracts' impact more interpretable) 
2. Have other sorts of summary statistics like funding for counties, funding for minorities, etc.
 - Racial or socioeconomic breakdown of designated vs. undesignated tracts
 - Some sort of print functionality (ability to print it as a report (county / tract))
 - 

- Some way of representing the intracategory spread 

- Decent amount of frontend polish
